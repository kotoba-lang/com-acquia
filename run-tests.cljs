(ns run-tests
  "Run the portable half of this actor's suite under nbb (ClojureScript on
  Node via SCI), so the .cljc is checked by the runtime that actually ships
  rather than only by the JVM.

  Coverage is DELIBERATELY partial, and the gap is exact. This repo has two
  test namespaces:

    acquia-compat.main-test  (.cljc) -- portable, listed below
    acquia-compat.kotoba-qualification-test  (.clj) -- JVM-only, NOT listed

  The qualification namespace requires kotoba.compiler.core, kotoba.runtime
  and kotoba.wasm-exec to compile src/acquia_compat/page_limit.kotoba and execute it on
  two backends. That toolchain is JVM-only, so nbb cannot run it and must
  not pretend to.

  Measured 2026-08-20 -- the two runtimes agree on the shared namespace:

    clojure -M:test   ->  Ran 8 tests containing 104 assertions
    this runner       ->      6 tests containing 94 assertions

  The difference is exactly 2 deftest(s) and 10 assertions, which is the
  whole of the two qualification namespaces (page_limit and paginate). If
  that arithmetic stops holding,
  one of the two runners has silently stopped running something.

  Every namespace is listed explicitly on purpose: clojure -M:test finds
  namespaces by scanning the test directory, but a cljs runner does not, so
  a namespace omitted here would never run and nothing would say so.
